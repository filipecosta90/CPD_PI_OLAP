We have presented a framework for Sparse Linear Algebra represent and query OLAP: In order to do so we develop from the start and parallelise a typed linear algebra solution to respond to OLAP TPC-H query 1,  in a way that the achieved time to compute the query surpasses the relational algebra competitor.\par 

The major challenge regarding this project was understanding the linear algebra theory prior defined\cite{macedo2015linear} \cite{da2015benchmarking}, in order to fully represent relational algebra in terms of linear algebra operators. This process was longstanding and it was only managed to do it with help of our advisors. Efforts were made in order to correctly introduce the main ideias prior presented\cite{macedo2015linear}, and resolving potential difficulties that prior implementations faced. \par

In spite the already 18x speedup regarding sequential linear algebra version and the 2x speedup regarding the parallel relational algebra engine, a lot of work can be done to further improve
the algorithm, and fully analyse TPC-H queries results, as stated on section \ref{future_work}, leaving several potential exploratory paths.
